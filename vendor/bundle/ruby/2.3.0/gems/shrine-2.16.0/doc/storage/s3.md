# Shrine::Storage::S3

The S3 storage handles uploads to Amazon S3 service, using the [aws-sdk-s3]
gem:

```rb
gem "aws-sdk-s3", "~> 1.2"
```

It can be initialized by providing the bucket name and credentials:

```rb
require "shrine/storage/s3"

s3 = Shrine::Storage::S3.new(
  bucket: "my-app", # required
  access_key_id: "abc",
  secret_access_key: "xyz",
  region: "eu-west-1",
)
```

The core features of this storage require the following AWS permissions:
`s3:ListBucket`, `s3:PutObject`, `s3:GetObject`, and `s3:DeleteObject`. If you
have additional upload options configured such as setting object ACLs, then
additional permissions may be required.

The storage exposes the underlying Aws objects:

```rb
s3.client #=> #<Aws::S3::Client>
s3.client.access_key_id #=> "abc"
s3.client.secret_access_key #=> "xyz"
s3.client.region #=> "eu-west-1"

s3.bucket #=> #<Aws::S3::Bucket>
s3.bucket.name #=> "my-app"

s3.object("key") #=> #<Aws::S3::Object>
```

## Public uploads

By default, uploaded S3 objects will have private visibility, meaning they can
only be accessed via signed expiring URLs generated using your private S3
credentials. If you would like to generate public URLs, you can tell S3 storage
to make uploads public:

```rb
s3 = Shrine::Storage::S3.new(public: true, **s3_options)

s3.upload(io, "key") # uploads with "public-read" ACL
s3.url("key")        # returns public (unsigned) object URL
```

## Prefix

The `:prefix` option can be specified for uploading all files inside a specific
S3 prefix (folder), which is useful when using S3 for both cache and store:

```rb
Shrine::Storage::S3.new(prefix: "cache", **s3_options)
```

## Upload options

Sometimes you'll want to add additional upload options to all S3 uploads. You
can do that by passing the `:upload_options` option:

```rb
Shrine::Storage::S3.new(upload_options: { acl: "private" }, **s3_options)
```

These options will be passed to aws-sdk-s3's methods for [uploading], [copying]
and [presigning].

You can also generate upload options per upload with the `upload_options`
plugin

```rb
class MyUploader < Shrine
  plugin :upload_options, store: -> (io, context) do
    if context[:version] == :thumb
      { acl: "public-read" }
    else
      { acl: "private" }
    end
  end
end
```

or when using the uploader directly

```rb
uploader.upload(file, upload_options: { acl: "private" })
```

Note that, unlike the `:upload_options` storage option, upload options given on
the uploader level won't be forwarded for generating presigns, since presigns
are generated using the storage directly.

## URL options

This storage supports various URL options that will be forwarded from uploaded
file.

```rb
s3.url(public: true)   # public URL without signed parameters
s3.url(download: true) # forced download URL
```

All other options are forwarded to the aws-sdk-s3 gem:

```rb
s3.url(expires_in: 15, response_content_disposition: "...")
```

## URL Host

If you want your S3 object URLs to be generated with a different URL host (e.g.
a CDN), you can specify the `:host` option to `#url`:

```rb
s3.url("image.jpg", host: "http://abc123.cloudfront.net")
#=> "http://abc123.cloudfront.net/image.jpg"
```

The host URL can include a path prefix, but it needs to end with a slash:

```rb
s3.url("image.jpg", host: "https://your-s3-host.com/prefix/") # needs to end with a slash
#=> "http://your-s3-host.com/prefix/image.jpg"
```

To have the `:host` option passed automatically for every URL, use the
`default_url_options` plugin.

```rb
plugin :default_url_options, store: { host: "http://abc123.cloudfront.net" }
```

If you would like to [serve private content via CloudFront], you need to sign
the object URLs with a special signer, such as [`Aws::CloudFront::UrlSigner`]
provided by the `aws-sdk-cloudfront` gem. The S3 storage initializer accepts a
`:signer` block, which you can use to call your signer:

```rb
require "aws-sdk-cloudfront"

signer = Aws::CloudFront::UrlSigner.new(
  key_pair_id:      "cf-keypair-id",
  private_key_path: "./cf_private_key.pem"
)

Shrine::Storage::S3.new(signer: signer.method(:signed_url))
# or
Shrine::Storage::S3.new(signer: -> (url, **options) { signer.signed_url(url, **options) })
```

## Presigns

The `#presign` method can be used for generating paramters for direct uploads
to Amazon S3:

```rb
s3.presign("/path/to/file") #=>
# {
#   url: "https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/...",
#   fields: { ... },  # blank for PUT presigns
#   headers: { ... }, # blank for POST presigns
#   method: "post",
# }
```

Additional presign options can be given in three places:

* in `Storage::S3#presign` by forwarding options
* in `:upload_options` option on this storage
* in `presign_endpoint` plugin through `:presign_options`

## Large files

The aws-sdk-s3 gem has the ability to automatically use multipart upload/copy
for larger files, splitting the file into multiple chunks and uploading/copying
them in parallel.

By default any files that are uploaded will use the multipart upload if they're
larger than 15MB, and any files that are copied will use the multipart copy if
they're larger than 150MB, but you can change the thresholds via
`:multipart_threshold`.

```rb
thresholds = { upload: 30*1024*1024, copy: 200*1024*1024 }
Shrine::Storage::S3.new(multipart_threshold: thresholds, **s3_options)
```

If you want to change how many threads aws-sdk-s3 will use for multipart
upload/copy, you can use the `upload_options` plugin to specify
`:thread_count`.

```rb
plugin :upload_options, store: -> (io, context) do
  { thread_count: 5 }
end
```

## Encryption

The easiest way to use server-side encryption for uploaded S3 objects is to
configure default encryption for your S3 bucket. Alternatively, you can pass
server-side encryption parameters to the API calls.

The `#upload` method accepts `:sse_*` options:

```rb
s3.upload(io, "key", sse_customer_algorithm: "AES256",
                     sse_customer_key:       "secret_key",
                     sse_customer_key_md5:   "secret_key_md5",
                     ssekms_key_id:          "key_id")
```

The `#presign` method accepts `:server_side_encryption_*` options for POST
presigns, and the same `:sse_*` options as above for PUT presigns.

```rb
s3.presign("key", server_side_encryption_customer_algorithm: "AES256",
                  server_side_encryption_customer_key:       "secret_key",
                  server_side_encryption_aws_kms_key_id:     "key_id")
```

When downloading encrypted S3 objects, the same server-side encryption
parameters need to be passed in.

```rb
s3.download("key", sse_customer_algorithm: "AES256",
                   sse_customer_key:       "secret_key",
                   sse_customer_key_md5:   "secret_key_md5")

s3.open("key", sse_customer_algorithm: "AES256",
               sse_customer_key:       "secret_key",
               sse_customer_key_md5:   "secret_key_md5")
```

If you want to use client-side encryption instead, you can instantiate the
storage with an `Aws::S3::Encryption::Client` instance.

```rb
client = Aws::S3::Encryption::Client.new(
  kms_key_id: "alias/my-key"
)

Shrine::Storage::S3(client: client, bucket: "my-bucket")
```

## Accelerate endpoint

To use Amazon S3's [Transfer Acceleration] feature, you can change the
`:endpoint` of the underlying client to the accelerate endpoint, and this will
be applied both to regular and presigned uploads, as well as download URLs.

```rb
Shrine::Storage::S3.new(endpoint: "https://s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com")
```

## Clearing cache

If you're using S3 as a cache, you will probably want to periodically delete
old files which aren't used anymore. S3 has a built-in way to do this, read
[this article][object lifecycle] for instructions.

Alternatively you can periodically call the `#clear!` method:

```rb
# deletes all objects that were uploaded more than 7 days ago
s3.clear! { |object| object.last_modified < Time.now - 7*24*60*60 }
```

## Request Rate and Performance Guidelines

Amazon S3 automatically scales to high request rates. For example, your
application can achieve at least 3,500 PUT/POST/DELETE and 5,500 GET requests
per second per prefix in a bucket (a prefix is a top-level "directory" in the
bucket). If your app needs to support higher request rates to S3 than that, you
can scale exponentially by using more prefixes.
