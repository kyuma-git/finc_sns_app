# Backgrounding

The [`backgrounding`][backgrounding] plugin enables you to move promoting and
deleting of files from record's lifecycle into background jobs. This is
especially useful if you're doing processing and/or you're storing files on an
external storage service.

The plugin provides `Attacher.promote` and `Attacher.delete` methods, which
allow you to hook up to promoting and deleting and spawn background jobs, by
passing a block.

```rb
Shrine.plugin :backgrounding

# makes all uploaders use background jobs
Shrine::Attacher.promote { |data| PromoteJob.perform_async(data) }
Shrine::Attacher.delete { |data| DeleteJob.perform_async(data) }
```

If you don't want to apply backgrounding for all uploaders, you can declare the
hooks only for specific uploaders (in this case it's still recommended to keep
the plugin loaded globally).

```rb
class MyUploader < Shrine
  # makes this uploader use background jobs
  Attacher.promote { |data| PromoteJob.perform_async(data) }
  Attacher.delete { |data| DeleteJob.perform_async(data) }
end
```

The yielded `data` variable is a serializable hash containing all context
needed for promotion/deletion. Now you just need to declare the job classes,
and inside them call `Attacher.promote` or `Attacher.delete`, this time with
the received data.

```rb
class PromoteJob
  include Sidekiq::Worker
  def perform(data)
    Shrine::Attacher.promote(data)
  end
end

class DeleteJob
  include Sidekiq::Worker
  def perform(data)
    Shrine::Attacher.delete(data)
  end
end
```

This example used Sidekiq, but obviously you could just as well use any other
backgrounding library. This setup will be applied globally for all uploaders.

If you're generating versions, and you want to process some versions in the
foreground before kicking off a background job, you can use the `recache`
plugin.

In your application you can use `Attacher#cached?` and `Attacher#stored?`
to differentiate between your background job being in progress and
having completed.

```rb
if user.avatar_attacher.cached? # background job is still in progress
  # ...
elsif user.avatar_attacher.stored? # background job has finished
  # ...
end
```

## `Attacher.promote` and `Attacher.delete`

In background jobs, `Attacher.promote` and `Attacher.delete` will resolve all
necessary objects, and do the promotion/deletion. If `Attacher.find_record` is
defined (which comes with ORM plugins), model instances will be treated as
database records, with the `#id` attribute assumed to represent the primary
key. Then promotion will have the following behaviour:

1. retrieves the database record
  * if record is not found, it finishes
  * if record is found but attachment has changed, it finishes
2. uploads cached file to permanent storage
3. reloads the database record
  * if record is not found, it deletes the promoted files and finishes
  * if record is found but attachment has changed, it deletes the promoted files and finishes
4. updates the record with the promoted files

Both `Attacher.promote` and `Attacher.delete` return a `Shrine::Attacher`
instance (if the action hasn't aborted), so you can use it to perform
additional tasks:

```rb
def perform(data)
  attacher = Shrine::Attacher.promote(data)
  attacher.record.update(published: true) if attacher && attacher.record.is_a?(Post)
end
```

### Plain models

You can also do backgrounding with plain models which don't represent database
records; the plugin will use that mode if `Attacher.find_record` is not
defined. In that case promotion will have the following behaviour:

1. instantiates the model
2. uploads cached file to permanent storage
3. writes promoted files to the model instance

You can then retrieve the promoted files via the attacher object that
`Attacher.promote` returns, and do any additional tasks if you need to.

## `Attacher#_promote` and `Attacher#_delete`

The plugin modifies `Attacher#_promote` and `Attacher#_delete` to call the
registered blocks with serializable attacher data, and these methods are
internally called by the attacher. `Attacher#promote` and `Attacher#delete!`
remain synchronous.

```rb
# asynchronous (spawn background jobs)
attacher._promote
attacher._delete(attachment)

# synchronous
attacher.promote
attacher.delete!(attachment)
```

## `Attacher.dump` and `Attacher.load`

The plugin adds `Attacher.dump` and `Attacher.load` methods for serializing
attacher object and loading it back up. You can use them to spawn background
jobs for custom tasks.

```rb
data = Shrine::Attacher.dump(attacher)
SomethingJob.perform_async(data)

# ...

class SomethingJob
  def perform(data)
    attacher = Shrine::Attacher.load(data)
    # ...
  end
end
```
