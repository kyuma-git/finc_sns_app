# Migration Helpers

The [`migration_helpers`][migration_helpers] plugin gives the attacher
additional helper methods which are convenient when doing file migrations.

The plugin also allows convenient delegating to these methods through the
model, by setting `:delegate`:

```rb
plugin :migration_helpers, delegate: true
```

## `update_stored`

This method updates the record's attachment with the result of the given block.

```rb
user.avatar_attacher.update_stored do |avatar|
  user.avatar_attacher.store.upload(avatar) # saved to the record
end

# with model delegation
user.update_avatar do |avatar|
  user.avatar_store.upload(avatar) # saved to the record
end
```

The block will get triggered _only_ if the attachment is present and not
cached, *and* will save the record only if the record's attachment hasn't
changed in the time it took to execute the block. This method is most useful
for adding/removing versions and changing locations of files.

## `cached?` and `stored?`

These methods return true if attachment exists and is cached/stored:

```rb
user.avatar_attacher.cached? # user.avatar && user.avatar_attacher.cache.uploaded?(user.avatar)
user.avatar_attacher.stored? # user.avatar && user.avatar_attacher.store.uploaded?(user.avatar)

# with model delegation
user.avatar_cached?
user.avatar_stored?
```

## `attachment_cache` and `attachment_store`

These methods return cache and store uploaders used by the underlying attacher:

```rb
# these methods already exist without migration_helpers
user.avatar_attacher.cache #=> #<Shrine @storage_key=:cache @storage=#<Shrine::Storage::FileSystem @directory=public/uploads>>
user.avatar_attacher.store #=> #<Shrine @storage_key=:store @storage=#<Shrine::Storage::S3:0x007fb8343397c8 @bucket=#<Aws::S3::Bucket name="foo">>>

# with model delegation
user.avatar_cache
user.avatar_store
```
