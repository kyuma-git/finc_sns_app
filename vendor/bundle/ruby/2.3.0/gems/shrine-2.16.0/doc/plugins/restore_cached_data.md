# Restore Cached Data

The [`restore_cached_data`][restore_cached_data] plugin re-extracts metadata
when assigning already cached files, i.e. when the attachment has been retained
on validation errors or assigned from a direct upload. In both cases you may
want to re-extract metadata on the server side, mainly to prevent tempering,
but also in case of direct uploads to obtain metadata that couldn't be
extracted on the client side.

```rb
plugin :restore_cached_data
```

It uses the `refresh_metadata` plugin to re-extract metadata.
